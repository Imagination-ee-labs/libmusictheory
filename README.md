# libmusictheory

## Overview

This is an experimental stab at a C library implementing the systematic logic of [music theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory) through a variety of helper functions. The idea is that we should only have to do this once, and then any higher-level language should hopefully be able to implement its own music theory library by providing wrappers to the C library functions.

## I have no idea what I'm doing (yet)

I find writing C painful. I've been learning Rust, and Rust seems to be a pretty good way to write C libraries, so I'm gonna give that a try.
